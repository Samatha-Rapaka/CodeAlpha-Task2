# CodeAlpha-Task3
Create a text-based chatbot that can have conversations with users. You can use natural language processing libraries like NLTK or spaCy to make your chatbot more conversational.
<h2>Explanation of the Code:</h2>
<h3>Imports:</h3>
We import nltk and specifically Chat and reflections from nltk.chat.util.

%1 in responses refers to the captured group in the pattern (e.g., the user's name).
<h3>Chatbot Function:</h3>
The chatbot() function initializes the chatbot and starts the conversation.
It uses the Chat class to handle the interaction.
